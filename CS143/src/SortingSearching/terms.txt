INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES WERE introduced briefly in A Preview of Calculus in con¬ nection with Zeno's paradoxes and the decimal representation of numbers. Their importance in calculus stems from Newton’s idea of representing functions as sums of infinite series. For instance, in finding areas he often integrated a function by first expressing it as a series and then integrating each term of the series. We will pursue his idea in Section 11.10 in order to integrate such functions as e~*~. (Recall that we have previously been unable to do this.) Many of the func¬ tions that arise in mathematical physics and chemistry, such as Bessel functions, are defined as sums of series, so it is important to be familiar with the basic concepts of convergence of infinite sequences and series.
